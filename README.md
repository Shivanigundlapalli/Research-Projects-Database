# üß† Research Projects Database

This project is a relational database model designed to manage information about **research projects**, their **employees**, **funding agencies**, and **project managers**. The database supports tracking of project details, employee assignments, and the funding structure using a normalized schema derived from an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.

## üìÅ Project Overview

The system models:
- Employees with their personal and professional details.
- Projects with duration, budget, and funding details.
- Funding agencies that support projects.
- Assignment of employees to projects (many-to-many).
- Assignment of one manager per project.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

### 1. `Employee`
Stores details about employees.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    SSN INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Emp_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 0)
);
 
2. FundingAgency
Stores information about agencies funding the projects.
CREATE TABLE FundingAgency (
    Agency_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Address VARCHAR(255)
);

3. Project
Contains project-specific information and the funding agency reference.
CREATE TABLE Project (
    Project_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Duration INT,
    Budget DECIMAL(12, 2),
    Agency_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Agency_ID) REFERENCES FundingAgency(Agency_ID)
);

4. Project_Manager
Maps a single manager to each project.
CREATE TABLE Project_Manager (
    Project_ID INT PRIMARY KEY, 
    Manager_SSN INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Project_ID) REFERENCES Project(Project_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Manager_SSN) REFERENCES Employee(SSN)
);

5. Employee_Project
Maps employees to the projects they are working on.
CREATE TABLE Employee_Project (
    SSN INT,
    Project_ID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (SSN, Project_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (SSN) REFERENCES Employee(SSN),
    FOREIGN KEY (Project_ID) REFERENCES Project(Project_ID)
);
